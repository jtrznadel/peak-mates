# 🚧 PeakMates: Work in Progress 🚧

## 📚 Introduction

Welcome to the **PeakMates** project! This mobile app is being developed to address a common issue among mountain enthusiasts: finding like-minded individuals to share their adventures with. Many people who love hiking and mountain trips end up traveling alone due to a lack of friends with similar interests. This not only increases costs but also deprives them of the joy and safety of companionship.

The primary goal of **PeakMates** is to create a social platform that enables users to:
- Find companions for mountain trips.
- Organize and realize group hiking adventures.
- Enjoy the company of fellow enthusiasts, making trips more enjoyable and safer.

## ✨ Final Functionalities

The final version of the app will include:
- User Registration and Login.
- Profile Creation and Management.
- Trip Creation and Discovery.
- In-app Messaging and Notifications.
- Real-time Location Sharing during trips.
- Review and Rating System for trip companions.
- Community Forum for discussions and advice.
